 <li> <h4>Welcome to board of School. We are a school which specializes in all boys&#8217; boarding education for pupils aged 12-18. The school is probably the only &#8216;All India&#8217;
  school with applications from almost every state each year, as well as from Indian families overseas. Established in 1935, board of School is one of India&#8217;s finest schools, with a strong intellectual heartbeat, 
  an unequivocal commitment to social service, a curriculum that develops leadership and an alumni network with a global reputation.</h4></li>

<p><center><a style="padding: 10px;" href="#"><img title="" src="Images/dav9.jpg" alt="" /></a></p></center>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<li><p>Board of School is a full boarding school for boys only and not simply a school which welcomes boarders. 
 The schoolâ€™s beautiful seventy acre campus with a vast range of flora, fauna and bird life provide all boys with ample green space and fresh air where they are able to live and learn. It is an environment rarely offered by schools in large and small cities in India, or indeed some other countries.
 All boys are able to seek advice from the teaching staff, the Wellness Centre and the school counsellor living on the school campus throughout the seven day week. Boys discover that they have much more time to study and pursue their wider interests.
 There is no wasted time travelling to learn Sport, Art, Music, Drama and benefit from Careers Guidance as well as other necessary university and college entrance preparation.</li>

<h3><center><a href="#">LEADERSHIP</a></center></h3>
<p><center><a style="padding:10px;" href="#"><img title="" src="Images/dav12.jpg" alt="" /></a></center></p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<li><p>The school culture encourages boys to innovate and take risks when developing new ideas and considering solutions to problems. At board of school, leadership is taught within the school&#8217;s curriculum as well as through a whole range of opportunities such as leading clubs and societies and sports teams. 
 House life through the prefect system, also provides leadership and collaborative experience. Leadership is also developed through innovative and creative projects linked to the school&#8217;s
 social service programme to leading and participating in the numerous academic and other committees that exist to discuss topics that range from food to the library and games to technology.
 the  board of School is  also most fortunate to be able to offer clean air and a wonderful space for boys to grow up and learn in. They
 are not confined to small school sites and a large polluted city where transport make their  daily lives and health so difficult. As potential leaders in any field the foundations are well set in seventy acres.</li>
